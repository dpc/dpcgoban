<h1>P2AGTP Draft</h1>

<h2>Intruduction</h2>
<p>This document gives a specification of the Engine to Arbiter Go Text Protocol (P2AGTP).
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Despite GTP is well made protocol it suites only go playing programs communication.
   It has many limitations that makes it impossible (or impractical at least) to use it for pure human online Go gaming.
   Those limitations were main reason of P2AGTP creation.
</p>

<h3>Communication Model</h3>
<p>The protocol is asymmetric and involves two parties, which we call <em>Arbiter</em> and <em>Player</em>.
</p>
<p>The <em>Player</em> is typically some kind of Go-playing interface like a program to play Go online, but may be as well a go playing program (an <em>engine</em> in GTP nomenclature). The main activity of a <em>Player</em> is playing a game (generating moves) or watching its progress (_observing_).
</p>
<p>The <em>Arbiter</em> manages board state, knows go game logic and validates <em>Players</em> actions.
</p>
<p>Typical situation involves one <em>Arbiter</em> and at least two <em>Players</em>. Each <em>Player</em> is connected to <em>Arbiter</em> via some error-free character-oriented communication channel (i.e. TCP/IP connection or UNIX pipe). Each such <em>Arbiter</em>-_Player_ connection is independent communication entity and everything described in this specification describes one such channel.
</p>
<p>All communication is request-response based and may be initiated by both <em>Arbiter</em> and <em>Player</em>.
</p>

<h2>Protocol Basis</h2>

<h3>Character Set</h3>
<p>All exchanged messages are considered as UTF-8 strings.
   Each request have a numeric ID and must be responded before any later requests.
</p>

<h3>Whitespace</h3>
<p>The following characters are considered as whitespace delimiter in the protocol:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     SPACE (dec 32)
 </li>

 <li>
     HT (dec 9)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>In the rest of the specification 'space' is used to denote a whitespace. On input this may be either one or more SPACE or HT characters. SPACE and HT can be mixed.
</p>

<h3>Newline Convention</h3>
<p>All messages (both requests and responses) are ended with single line break LF (dec 10) character. The CR (dec 13) should not be used and should be discarded on input.
</p>

<h3>Request structure</h3>
<p>A command should is exacly one line long, white a syntax:
</p>
<p><tt>
       id command_name [arguments]
   </tt>
